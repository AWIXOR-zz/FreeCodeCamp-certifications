                    <h5> <span><strong>570</strong></span> - Muhammad's Birth and Infancy</h5>
                    <p>Muhammad was born in the year 570 in the town of Mecca, a mountain town in the high desert
                        plateau of western Arabia. His name derives from the Arabic verb hamada, meaning "to praise, to
                        glorify." He was the first and only son of Abd Allah bin Al-Muttalib and Amina bint Wahb. Abd
                        Allah died before Muhammad's birth and Muhammad was raised by his mother Amina, who in keeping
                        with Meccan tradition entrusted her son at an early age to a wet nurse named Halima from the
                        nomadic tribe of the Sa'd ibn Bakr. He grew up in the hill country, learning their pure Arabic.

                    <h5><span><strong>570</strong></span> - Muhammad Becomes an Orphan</h5>
                    <p>When Muhammad was five or six his mother took him to Yathrib, an oasis town a few hundred miles
                        north of Mecca, to stay with relatives and visit his father's grave there. On the return
                        journey, Amina took ill and died. She was buried in the village of Abwa on the Mecca-Medina
                        Road. Halima, his nurse, returned to Mecca with the orphaned boy and placed him in the
                        protection of his paternal grandfather, Abdul Al-Muttalib. In this man's care, Muhammad learned
                        the rudiments of statecraft. Mecca was Arabia's most important pilgrimage center and Abdul
                        Al-Muttalib its most respected leader. He controlled important pilgrimage concessions and
                        frequently presided over Mecca's Council of Elders. </p>

                    <h5><span><strong>578</strong></span> - Muhammad in Mecca in Care of an Uncle</h5>
                    <p>Upon his grandfather's death in 578, Muhammad, aged about eight, passed into the care of a
                        paternal uncle, Abu Talib. Muhammad grew up in the older man's home and remained under Abu
                        Talib's protection for many years. Chroniclers have underscored Muhammad's disrupted childhood.
                        So does the Qur'an: "Did God not find you an orphan and give you shelter and care? And He found
                        you wandering, and gave you guidance. And he found you in need, and made you independent"
                        (93:6-8). </p>

                    <h5><span><strong>580-594</strong></span> -Muhammad's Teens</h5>
                    <p>When young boy, Muhammad worked as a shepherd to help pay his keep (his uncle was of modest
                        means). In his teens he sometimes traveled with Abu Talib, who was a merchant, accompanying
                        caravans to trade centers. On at least one occasion, he is said to have traveled as far north as
                        Syria. Older merchants recognized his character and nicknamed him El–Amin, the one you can
                        trust. </p>

                    <h5><span><strong>594</strong></span> -Muhammad Acts as Caravan Agent for Wealthy Tradeswoman,
                        Khadija</h5>
                    <p>In his early twenties, Muhammad entered the service of a wealthy Meccan merchant, a widow named
                        Khadija bint Khawalayd. The two were distant cousins. Muhammad carried her goods to the north
                        and returned with a profit. </p>

                    <p>Impressed by Muhammad's honesty and character, Khadija eventually proposed marriage. They were
                        wed in about 595. He was twenty-five. She was nearly forty.
                        Muhammad continued to manage Khadija's business affairs, and their next years were pleasant and
                        prosperous. Six children were born to them, two sons who both died in infancy, and four
                        daughters. Mecca prospered too, becoming a well–off trading center in the hands of an elite
                        group of clan leaders who were mostly successful traders.</p>

                    <h5><span><strong>610</strong></span> -Muhammad Receives First Revelation</h5>
                    <p>Mecca's new materialism and its traditional idolatry disturbed Muhammad. He began making long
                        retreats to a mountain cave outside town. There, he fasted and meditated. On one occasion, after
                        a number of indistinct visionary experiences, Muhammad was visited by an overpowering presence
                        and instructed to recite words of such beauty and force that he and others gradually attributed
                        them to God. This experience shook Muhammad to the core. It was several years before he dared to
                        talk about it outside his family. </p>

                    <h5><span><strong>613</strong></span> -Muhammad Takes his Message Public</h5>
                    <p>After several similar experiences, Muhammad finally began to reveal the messages he was receiving
                        to his tribe. These were gathered verse by verse and later would become the Qur'an, Islam's
                        sacred scripture. In the next decade, Muhammad and his followers were first belittled and
                        ridiculed, then persecuted and physically attacked for departing from traditional Mecca's tribal
                        ways. Muhammad's message was resolutely monotheistic. For several years, the the Quraysh,
                        Mecca's dominant tribe, levied a ban on trade with Muhammad's people, subjecting them to near
                        famine conditions. Toward the end of the decade, Muhammad's wife and uncle both died. Finally,
                        the leaders of Mecca attempted to assassinate Muhammad.</p>

                    <h5><span><strong>622</strong></span> -Muhammad and the Muslims Emigrate to Medina</h5>
                    <p>In 622, Muhammad and his few hundred followers left Mecca and traveled to Yathrib, the oasis town
                        where his father was buried. The leaders there were suffering through a vicious civil war, and
                        they had invited this man well known for his wisdom to act as their mediator. Yathrib soon
                        became known as Medina, the City of the Prophet. Muhammad remained here for the next six years,
                        building the first Muslim community and gradually gathering more and more people to his side.

                    <h5><span><strong>625-628</strong></span> -The Military Period</h5>
                    <p>The Meccans did not take Muhammad's new success lightly. Early skirmishes led to three major
                        battles in the next three years. Of these the Muslims won the first (the Battle of Badr, March,
                        624), lost the second (the Battle of Uhud, March, 625), and outlasted the third, (The Battle of
                        the Trench and the Siege of Medina, April, 627). In March, 628, a treaty was signed between the
                        two sides, which recognized the Muslims as a new force in Arabia and gave them freedom to move
                        unmolested throughout Arabia. Meccan allies breached the treaty a year later.</p>

                    <h5><span><strong>630</strong></span> -The Conquest of Mecca</h5>
                    <p>By now, the balance of power had shifted radically away from once-powerful Mecca, toward Muhammad
                        and the Muslims. In January, 630, they marched on Mecca and were joined by tribe after tribe
                        along the way. They entered Mecca without bloodshed and the Meccans, seeing the tide had turned,
                        joined them.</p>

                    <h5><span><strong>630-632</strong></span> -Muhammad's Final Years</h5>
                    <p>Muhammad returned to live in Medina. In the next three years, he consolidated most of the Arabian
                        Peninsula under Islam. In March, 632, he returned to Mecca one last time to perform a
                        pilgrimage, and tens of thousands of Muslims joined him.

                        After the pilgrimage, he returned to Medina. Three months later on June 8, 632 he died there,
                        after a brief illness. He is buried in the mosque in Medina. Within a hundred years Muhammad's
                        teaching and way of life had spread from the remote corners of Arabia as far east as Indo-China
                        and as far west as Morocco, France and Spain.</p>
